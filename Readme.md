📄 How to Run

Clone the repository

Configure GitHub API

No authentication configuration needed at the backend level.The client (frontend or API consumers) must provide the GitHub token per request via the Authorization header.

Example header:

Authorization: Bearer <your_github_token>

Run the Application

./mvnw spring-boot:run

or

./gradlew bootRun

By default, the server runs at http://localhost:8080.
