📄 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
bash


git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-org-manager-backend.git
cd github-org-manager-backend
2. Configure GitHub API
No authentication configuration is needed at the backend level.
The client (frontend or API consumers) must provide the GitHub token per request via the Authorization header.

Example header:

http


Authorization: Bearer <your_github_token>
3. Run the Application
Using Maven:

bash


./mvnw spring-boot:run
Or using Gradle:

bash


./gradlew bootRun
By default, the server runs at:
http://localhost:8080
